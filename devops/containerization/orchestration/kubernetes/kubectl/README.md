```
kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
```

Let's break this down:

- `kubectl:` The command-line tool itself. <br />

- `[command]:` Specifies what action you want to perform. Common commands include:
  - `get`: Display one or many resources.
  - `describe`: Show details about a specific resource.
  - `create`: Create a new resource.
  - `delete`: Delete resources.
  - `apply`: Apply a configuration to a resource. We'll use this a lot later.
- `[TYPE]:` Specifies the Kubernetes resource type you want to interact with. Common resource types include:
  - `pods`: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes.
  - `deployments`: Manage sets of pods for scaling and updates.
  - `services`: Expose applications running in pods.
  - `nodes`: The worker machines in your Kubernetes cluster.
  - `namespaces`: Logical groupings of resources.
- `[NAME]:` The name of a specific resource. This is optional; if you omit the name, `kubectl` will operate on all resources of the specified type.
- `[flags]:` Optional flags to modify the command's behavior (e.g., `-n <namespace>`, `-o wide`).
